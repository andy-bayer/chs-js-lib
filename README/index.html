<h2>The Static Site</h2>
<p>
    This directory contains the files needed to generate the static site, which is hosted at
    codehs.github.io/chs-js-lib.
</p>
<p>
    This site is built using a tool called eleventy, which will generate a site from templates. For
    more on eleventy, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/">see the documentation</a>.
</p>
<h2>Building the Static Site</h2>
<p>To build the static site, run <code>npm run site:watch</code>, which will do the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>build the library and copy it into the <code>site/assets</code> folder</li>
    <li>
        build documentation using <code>jsdoc</code> and copy it into the
        <code>site/docs</code> folder
    </li>
    <li>
        run eleventy in &quot;watch&quot; mode, which will automatically rebuild when the templates
        change.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    You can then run the site locally by navigating to <code>_site</code> and running a static
    server. If you have Python 2 installed, you should be able to run
    <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>, or with <code>node</code> you can run
    <code>npm install -g http-server</code> and <code>http-server</code>.
</p>
<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>
    The templates used for the static site are in the <code>_includes</code> folder as
    <code>.11ty.js</code> files. These are JavaScript files that export a function that will take
    data and return HTML from it.
</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>
    Any <code>.md</code> or <code>.html</code> file in the <code>site</code> folder is turned into
    HTML (including this page!).
</p>
<p>
    Directives at the top of the <code>.html</code> or <code>.md</code> file are used to describe
    the data that should be passed into the template and the template file which should be used.
</p>
<p>
    The examples in the <code>examples/</code> folder are a content file (markdown or html) and a
    script, which will be loaded in the template. The <code>code</code> directive in the top of the
    content file specifies the name of the script that should be loaded. It will search in the
    directory where the markdown or html file is.
</p>
